Learning Nextjs 14v

=> Client and server components
	-> By default in nextjs everything is servercomponent and to convert it into client comp 
	    we have to mention at top of the file as "use client"so that we can use react hooks

 -> whenever we creating a component we have to use page.jsx to render the component.
 -> How we structure the folder thats how the routing works.
	-->app/
	    -->products/   ->>nested routes.
 -> dynamic routes -->app/
			--> products/
				-->[details]/
					-->page.jsx 
 -> for n number of slug likes /products/1/2/3/4 we have to use [...product-review] folder to catch all the slug.
