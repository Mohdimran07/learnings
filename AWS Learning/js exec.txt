How JS is executed?

Each browser has a JS Engine to execute js in browsers.
	V8 on chrome
	JavaScriptCore on safari
	SpiderMonkey on Mozilla.
	Chakra on Microsoft Edge. and many other Js Engine that run within web browser

At First,the js engine do parsing (means converts the source code into tokens (like let, const, functions etc..,) , 
operators , literals, and identifiers)  and then this js engine passes this tokens to create the abstract syntax tree(AST).

the next step is compilation (JIT=> Just In Time uses by modern code ) where js code complies into machine code so that it can be executed.

after that we can see the effects of our code in browser so in this step our engine starts to interpret our js code which is executed 
by the Javascript virtual machine and once it is executed we can see the effect on our web broswer in chorme.

And once it is executed it also goes through garbage collection step it scans and cleans up the unused variable and unreachable memory

And in the last step we have the event loop , basically since js is a single threaded synchronous language so it cannot perform
time consuming operations synchronolous and this event loop continous checks the call stack.
