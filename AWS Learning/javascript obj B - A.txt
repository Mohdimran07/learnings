Basics of JavaScript Objects
	Understanding objects: Objects are collections of key-value pairs that store related data and functionality.
	Creating objects: Use object literals ({}) or the new keyword to create objects.
	Accessing object properties: Use dot notation (obj.prop) or bracket notation (obj['prop']) to access properties.
	Adding and modifying properties: Assign values to new or existing properties to add or modify them.
	Deleting properties: Use the delete operator to remove properties from an object.

Advanced Object Manipulation Techniques.
	Merging objects: Use Object.assign() or the spread operator (...) to merge properties from multiple objects.
	Filtering objects: Use Object.keys() and Array.prototype.filter() to create a new object with a subset of properties.
	Mapping object keys and values: Use Object.entries() and Array.prototype.reduce() to transform an object by mapping its keys and values.
	Flattening nested objects: Use recursion and Object.assign() to flatten nested objects into a single level.
	Immutable object updates: Use the spread operator (...) or Object.assign() to create new objects with updated properties.

Object Prototypes and Inheritance
	Understanding prototypes: Every object has a prototype, which is another object that serves as a template for the object.
	Prototype chain: When accessing a property or method on an object, JavaScript searches the prototype chain until it finds the property or method.
	Creating objects with prototypes: Use constructor functions or classes to create objects with shared prototypes.
	Inheritance: Objects can inherit properties and methods from their prototypes, allowing for code reuse and polymorphism.

Advanced Object Concepts
	Object equality and comparison: Understand how object equality works and how to compare objects.
	Garbage collection: JavaScript automatically manages memory using garbage collection, which removes objects that are no longer reachable.
	Object methods and this: Methods are functions stored as object properties, and this refers to the object the method is called on.
	Getters and setters: Define custom behavior for accessing and modifying object properties using getters and setters.

Practical Applications of Objects
	Creating complex data structures: Use objects to represent real-world entities and their relationships.
	Implementing object-oriented design patterns: Apply design patterns like constructor, factory, and singleton to create modular and maintainable code.
	Working with JSON: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format based on JavaScript object syntax.
	Interacting with APIs: Many APIs return data in the form of objects, which can be manipulated and displayed in your application.
